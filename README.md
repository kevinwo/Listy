# Listy

Listy is yet another multiplatform to-do list app. You can add and delete lists and add and delete tasks. It truly is a productivity wonder.

## Why another to-do app?

I wanted to demonstrate an implementation of [VIPER architecture](https://www.objc.io/issues/13-architecture/viper/) in a cross-platform scenario. There are many VIPER architecture examples in the wild, but I haven't seen any that tackle code reusability. Hence, the birth of Listy, a to-do app that will run on any fruit-labled device.

## Project Structure & Features

The following is a brief breakdown of how I structured my Xcode project, labeled by scheme name:

### App Targets

#### Listy iOS

To-do'ing from your iPhone and iPad; iOS 12+

#### Listy tvOS

Manage to-dos from the comfort of couch and television; tvOS 12+

#### Listy watchOS

To-dos on your wrist; watchOS 5.1+

#### Listy macOS

To-dos on your Mac.

‚ö†Ô∏è I am not a macOS developer. Please go gentle on UI/UX feedback! üôè

### Supporting Frameworks

The frameworks are shared code connected to platform-specific implementations of Cocoa Touch frameworks internal to the project

### ListyUI

ListyUI provides reusable UIKit-driven functionality.

- [x] List and task views
- [x] Table view data sources and delegates
- [x] Error alert presentation
- [x] View controller presentation

### ListyKit

ListyKit provides reusable Foundation-driven functionality.

- [x] List and task presenters and interactors
- [x] Entity models and persistence
- [x] Error handling and view routing protocols

## Setup

- Clone this repository.
- Build for any app scheme in the Listy.xcodeproj.
- Run and enjoy.
