# Listy

Listy is yet another multiplatform to-do list app, and it does the most amazing things, like let you add lists and tasks – even delete them – and see what an app with multiple layers might look like. Enjoy!

## Apps

### Listy iOS

This is the main iOS app target, consisting of list and edit views for lists and tasks.

### Listy tvOS

This is the main tvOS app target, consisting of list and edit views for lists and tasks.

## Internal Frameworks

### ListyUI

This framework provides most of the UIKit-driven functionality, with fun things like reusable collection-based data sources which you can use across different platforms.

### ListyKit

This framework provides Foundation-driven functionality, and should be usable on iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS, anywhere!

## Install

You should just be able to git clone this repository, build, and run/test!
