# Listy

Listy is yet another multiplatform to-do list app, and it does the most amazing things, like let you add lists and tasks ‚Äì even delete them ‚Äì and see what an app with multiple layers might look like. Enjoy!

# Why another to-do app?

There are a number of VIPER architecture examples in the wild, but I had not come across something that shows how VIPER can be applied in a DRY fashion across multiple platforms. Therefore, I decided to put together and share the way I code in the form of a to-do app.

## Apps

### Listy iOS

This is the main iOS app target, consisting of list and edit views for lists and tasks.

### Listy tvOS

This is the main tvOS app target, consisting of list and edit views for lists and tasks.

### Listy watchOS

This is the main watchOS app target, consisting of list and edit views for lists and tasks.

### Listy macOS

This is the main macOS app target, consisting of list and edit views for lists and tasks.

‚ö†Ô∏è I am not a macOS developer. Please go gentle on feedback! üôè

## Internal Frameworks

### ListyUI

This framework provides most of the UIKit-driven functionality, with fun things like reusable collection-based data sources which you can use across different platforms.

### ListyKit

This framework provides Foundation-driven functionality, and should be usable on iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS, anywhere!

## Install

You should just be able to git clone this repository, build, and run/test!
